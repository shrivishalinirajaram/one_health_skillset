## Data distribution

A distribution describes how values of a variable are spread out. Say **Shape** of a data.

It answers questions like:

- What values are most common?
- Are most values small or large?
- Are there many zeros or extreme outliers?
- Is the distribution symmetric, skewed, or multimodal?

Basically it is the fingerprint of variability in a dataset.

## **Why knowing the type of distribution is so important?**

- Determines the choice of statistical tests.
- Influences the interpretation of results.
- Helps in understanding the underlying biological processes.
- Affects the assumptions of normalization and models used in microbiome analysis.

**When we say assumptions, what will happen if the data does not follow the assumed distribution?**

- p values of the statistical tests may not be valid.
- Confidence intervals may be misleading.
- Model predictions may be inaccurate.
- Normalization methods may not work as expected.
- Biological interpretations may be flawed.

If we plotted all the values on a graph, the distribution is the curve we would see.

Say for eg., 
You measured the relative abundance of a bacteria across 100 samples.

- If it is always around 0.2 ---> tight, narrow distribution
- If it jumps from 0 to 0.8 wildly ---> wide, scattered distribution
- If it is mostly 0, but a few have 0.9 ---> zero-inflated, skewed distribution
- If it has multiple peaks ---> multimodal distribution

A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes in a random variable.

It provides a complete description of the variability in the data.

For **discrete** variables, it gives the **probability mass function (PMF)** i.e., the probability of each possible value.

**Probability Mass Function (PMF)**  
For a discrete random variable \( X \):

$$
P(X = x) = p(x), \quad \text{where} \quad \sum_{x} p(x) = 1
$$


For **continuous** variables, it gives the **probability density function (PDF)** that describes the likelihood of values within a range.
This is often visualized as a curve. Total area under the curve = 1.

**Probability Density Function (PDF)**  
For a continuous random variable \( X \):

$$
f(x) \geq 0, \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = 1
$$

Probability that \( X \) lies in an interval \([a, b]\) is:

$$
P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
$$

### Common types of distributions

1. **Normal Distribution (Gaussian)**  
   - Bell-shaped curve, symmetric around the mean.
   - Characterized by mean (μ) - center and standard deviation (σ) - Spread.
   - Many statistical tests assume normality.

   $$ 
   f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} 
   $$
